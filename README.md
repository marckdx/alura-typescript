## Installation

Be sure, first of all, that you have Node.js installed on your machine ([download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

After the commands being executed your default browser should open at http://localhost:3000/ on a screen like the following:

## Technologies

* [Concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) for running more than one command on NodeJS;
* [Lite Server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) for running the application, acting as a server;
* [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) as development language/superset.
